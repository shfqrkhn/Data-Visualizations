## Navigating the Repository

Each project is contained within its own folder, named clearly with the date it was added and a brief description of the project. Inside each folder, you will typically find:

* The dataset(s) used (or a link/description of where the data was obtained).
* Analysis scripts (e.g., Python notebooks, R scripts).
* Visualization files (e.g., image files of plots, Tableau workbooks).
* A project-specific README or documentation explaining the analysis and findings in more detail.

Feel free to explore each folder to see the process and results of each project.
